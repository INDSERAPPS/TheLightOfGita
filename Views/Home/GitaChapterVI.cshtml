                The words ‘Atma samnyama’ refer to the control of one’s mind. It looks for as to how mind can be withdrawn from sense objects and can be directed towards the Supreme. A man’s mind is generally filled with a number of thoughts, positive and negative. ‘Dhyana’ refers to meditating upon God the infinite love and consciousness. It is the true dhyana or meditation.Naturally all the thoughts are related to mundanities and attached to sensual desires. Peace of mind is disturbed as the thought waves are increasing and even overlapping continuously. When the thoughts are very few one feels more and more peace of mind. By controlling the thoughts, related to sensual objects one can get internal peace. When the thought waves subside one’s mind becomes peaceful. Yoga is easy for a peaceful mind. When thought waves are continuously generated in one’s mind, one after another or simultaneously it becomes difficult to maintain equipose of mind. By the dhyana of the Supreme consciousness in the form of love and compassion one can easily get control over his senses and mind. It is said that the unit self (soul) shall have a long pilgrimage through births and deaths until the mind becomes purified enough to be merged with the Supreme. Dhyana helps one to purify his mind.

        He who does all actions with the motive of getting fruits there from, is neither a sanyasin nor a yogi. One also does not become a samnyasin by not performing actions.  A samnyasin means one who is established himself in God and surrendered everything unto Him. It is inevitable for everybody to perform certain actions or karma. Proper action is one without desiring for fruits. A person not performing any action or work is a parasite depending on others for his needs. A sanyasin is not in his form (outward appearance) but in his real mental status. Most of the modern pseudo sanyasin live luxuriously at the expense of others. They are materialists. A samyasin is one; who is without desires, loving, truthful, leads a simple life and stands for the welfare of others.      Do all possible right actions submitting the fruits unto God.

        Even when samnyasa and yoga are considered as the same, no one can become a yogi without giving up the intense thoughts of material pleasures.


        Remaining without attachment internally to material pleasures is really the state of yoga. Human mind is characterized by a spontaneous flow of sensual thoughts and desires. His mind is often like an agitated sea. Those who know the secret of dreams say that sea is an image of one’s mind. Where the desires subside one’s mind becomes deep and peaceful as a calm sea without waves. Yoga is internal peace and bliss.

        When a man is unattached to the objects of senses or actions and he who has renounced all his thoughts of worldly pleasures; he is said to have mounted on the heights of yoga.

Thoughts related to mundanities disturb one’s mind as pleasure principle is a guiding factor of thoughts
        in his mind. A person who has given up the desires and fruits of action can climb up the highest level of yoga or realization.

        One should progress by his right action and should not degrade himself. He should know that his own self is the friend of his soul, so also the soul’s enemy.  One’s soul should be directed towards higher planes by his purified mind. No individual can exist without the soul. Mind is formed by the blind forces of Prakriti. When an individual acts against his atma it becomes weak. It is the atma that suffers the pains of the actions and enjoys the pleasures. One should purify his mind to become a friend of his soul.The self becomes a friend of the soul when one has conquered his mind, senses and body. Where one could not have control over his senses, mind and body, his self acts as an enemy. One’s lower self represents mind, senses and body. It is the lower self acting as friend or enemy of the soul. One’s soul (atma) is only a witnessing entity in him and does not do any action, though enjoys or suffers the fruits of action.

Deep meditation is not generally possible in a collection of persons or groups. Ideational unity cannot be attained in collectivity. It is because the mental vibrations of different persons are different. But collective prayers have some other benefits. Meditation is individualistic and should be done in seclusion.

        The proper place (spot) for meditation is a clean place where kusa grass grows. A deer skin spread on the grass and a cloth upon it, a place neither very high nor very low is suitable for mediation. Meditation requires a calm and clean place. A place covered with kusa grass (a particular glass), placing a deer skin on it and there upon a cloth spread is said to be ideal for mediation. Instead of deer skin, tiger skin is also used. Some prefer tiger skin because it removes the fear complex if any. While performing meditation electronic waves are produced in the body, a nonconductor like a deer skin or tiger skin is found to be good. But time passed. The wild animal’s skin is forbidden by law. Even without this, meditation is possible and the union will also take place. The basis is the mind. Meditation is to be performed seated in a proper place controlling the mind in seclusion. This shall be intended for the purification on one’s mind. Meditations taking true ideation of the God (Supreme love or Supreme consciousness) can only purify one’s mind. If one meditates God as supreme power it would inevitably bring bondage of desires aggravated by the ideation of power. Purification of mind and realization of God is possible only by meditating upon the Supreme beyond all powers or the forces of Prakriti. Purusa (consciousness) is God.

A Comfortable seat and posture are desirable. Before starting meditation first a proper seat and then purity of mind are insisted. ‘Sukha Stira Assana’ i.e. the most confortable seat is preferred. One must do meditation consciously. There are many instances of one falling into his unconscious without control over the conscious part of the mind. It is not advisable to go into the unconscious state without having control over one’s mind. It is harmful too. Meditation shall not be performed speedily. It must be calm and slow. Do not perform meditation under the pressure of anybody. Perform meditation in a calm and secluded place, if possible, and be always conscious during meditation.

Those whose minds are engaged in fantasy (daydreams) cannot do meditation.

Control of mind is an essential part of yoga. One shall have the willingness and effort to control his mind. Without effort no one can control his mind.

        Arjuna asked Krisna: What is a fate of a soul who has faith in God but could not control his mind and whose mind is diverted from yoga, failing to attain perfection by the realization of God? It is a relevant question; Arjuna fears of his death in the impending war.

        A yogi is greater than ascetics. So also He is well versed in sacred practices and is superior to those performing actions with certain motives. Yogi means a person who could merge his soul with Paramatma. His ultimate goal is to become one with the Supreme. But a man of wisdom may not have reached that state. The state of yoga is the highest goal and the state of perfect peacefulness. yoginam api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā sraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ sa me yuktatamo mataḥ 47 Krisna said: But according to My opinion those who worship the inner self of Me very carefully, are superior.  For every yogi union of soul with the Supreme is the goal. There are some worshipping the Divine without any desire. They are actually the great. But they must perform the worship carefully and constantly. Such people do not desire for liberation or happiness either.
