        <div class="row">
            <p class="slokadescription">
                The term yoga refers to the union of individual soul (unit self) with the Supreme (Paramatma). The Seers, the wise and the devotees of God incessantly try to attain the state of communion of their souls with the God, the Supreme consciousness. Those who try for the communion of soul by acquiring right knowledge of the Paramatma (Supreme) are called the Sankhya. Sri Krisna tries to reveal the secret of Sankhya yoga in this chapter. We are fortunate enough to know it through the discussions of Arjuna and Sri Krisna. The process of Jnana yoga, unveils the secrets of the most subtle realms of human mind   and even beyond. It is true that the discussion is not mainly concerned with the message of war but of the deep inner realities and possibilities of the human mind.
            </p>
            <p class="slokadescription">
                The discussion is not only confined to mind but also of subtler realms, i.e. related to spirituality. The impending war acts only as a veil to the secrets being revealed. We can see through out this chapter that a Pandora’s Box of knowledge open. We shall approach it with utmost humbleness to get the hidden knowledge unveiled. SriKrisna opens his deep discussion on conscious realms, starting from this chapter onwards, like a beautiful lotus getting slowly bloomed into its perfect beauty and glory.

        <br />Bishma was the great grand uncle of Pandavas and Kauravas and Drona was the guru who taught the art of archery to both the Pandavas and the Kauravas.

Some may blame one stating that he would have and should have done such and such acts or work in the past. It is a technique to stop other’s arguments. No one can go back to the past and correctly do a work again. The irony is that the person blaming others so, would not have been ready to give any suggestion at the time of doing the action in the past. Such blamers are evil minded, negative and sinners. <br />

        We see that most of the devotees of God do worship Him to get worldly pleasures. They do not want to attain the divine God but his bounteous prosperities. They worship at temples and homes for acquiring wealth and pleasures. Such worships are not spiritual and not related to the Supreme consciousness. Spirit refers to the ultimate truth, the God. <br/>

        When a person observes complete fasting and gives up food, his sense organs may withdraw their functions temporarily. But the craving for sensual pleasures will remain active in his mind. However, when a stable minded person realizes the Supreme, all his desires for worldly pleasures would disappear forthwith.<br /> 
        The enjoyment or bliss one derives on realizing God is infinite, immeasurable and fabulous. There is no comparison of it with the silly sources of worldly enjoyments.<br />

        The fact is that even in the case of a person striving to control his senses, the blind sensory organs may forcefully carry him away. <br />
        It is very difficult to control one’s sensory organs; but possible. It calls for one’s earnest effort of shunning of arrogance and the grace of God or a great Guru.  <br />

        He who meditates upon God controlling his senses can attain the state of stable mindedness. Normally the sensory organs move towards its objects of enjoyment and bring disturbance to one’s mind.

        He who has attachment to sensory objects and is trying to acquire such objects of enjoyment develops lust over sensual pleasures and objects. When one’s desires are not satisfied he becomes angry.<br />

        As a result of anger one develops infatuation (samogha). Infatuation causes confusion in the memory leading to the loss of reasoning and then to complete ruin.<br />
        It is true that anger may lose the balance of mind of an individual. When a person is overcome by anger, he speaks forgetting all his relations. He may use very crude, unrefined, abusing and insulting words on others thinking that all are his opponents. Anger is a psychological illness. It is to be noted that he who becomes seriously angry every now and then and if his anger lasts for a longer time, he is on the verge of a total mental disorder.<br />

        A man who has control over his senses remains awake and conscious in the world, considered as ignorance by others. The mundane world where all the creatures remain awake is equal to night or ignorance to a stable minded person.<br />
        The meaning is that what is real to the ordinary men and animals is not real to a ‘Samnysasin’ or self-controlled individual. It is a world of miseries to him. But for a man with uncontrolled mind, the mundane world is only the real and the world above is unreal and unknown to him. For a stable minded man, established in the thoughts of God, the worldly life is painful and equal to hell. His prayer is to deliver him from the worldly pains and miseries.<br />
