        <br />
        <div class="row">
            <p class="slokadescription">
                The term Rajavidya or Rajayoga refers to the noble yoga or the great yoga
                method. Guhya refers to the secret of yoga. Yogavidya is great and secret. It is
                imparted by great masters or Gurus to their disciples directly and secretly. There
                cannot be any agent to a great Guru. All are not eligible to practice yoga vidya.
                The eligibility is to be attained by a certain level of purification of one’s mind. It is the minimum qualification required for imparting Yoga vidya to an aspirant. Yoga
                is vidya (positive) and if it is not practiced properly it would turn to be Avidya
                (negative). A word may have a positive and negative meanings and impacts. For
                example the word Siva and its concept; Siva means pure consciousness (Supreme
                God or Paramatma). If one worships Siva thinking that He is consciousness it is
                spiritual. But on the other hand if one worships thinking that Siva is power it is
                Avidya. Power worship will not help one to attain the Supreme. Therefore
                worshipping God as power is Avidya. ‘Sa vidya ya Vimuktaye’; it is Vidya that
                liberates one from all bondages, while Avidya binds one again and again. Here is
                the clear concept of God in Bagavad Gita as regard to spirituality. Therefore those
                worshipping God as power can’t attain Him. A spiritual master would impart
                Yogavidya to his disciple secretly imbibing the right ideation of the concept of God.
                Yogasana is not yoga. It is Hatayoga; it is physical postures for making one’s body
                healthy and suitable to practice yoga. Yogavidya is to be imparted secretly to an
                aspirant and not to a group. Group yoga is suitable for physical exercises only.

        It is the answer to the question of what is the purpose of yoga. The ultimate
        aim of the practice of yoga is freedom from miseries. By the practice of yoga one can purify his mind and get liberated from all worries and pains. Nirguna Brahma
        is a state of pure consciousness.

        The practice of yoga gives one immense pleasure and enthusiasm. It is a
        divine process to attain the Supreme. It is the practice of Dharma and is the
        ultimate moral obligation of everybody. Everyone shall one day practice it. It is not
        simply long inhaling and exhaling of air; into and out of one’s body. One should
        simultaneously and progressively develop the true ideation of conscious love and
        affection of Brahma within. Paranyama followed by right ideation may help yoga.
        Right ideation (Bhava) transforms one’s mind positively.

        Those wise men who desire to have the enjoyment for their virtuous action;
        reaching the extensive heaven, return back to the earth on exhausting the stock of
        their merits. Those craving for enjoyment fall victims of birth and deaths.
        Though one knows Vedas he may have the desire for sensual enjoyments.
        He may perform rituals with intense desire of worldly enjoyments; and may
        repeatedly take birth becoming the easy victim of the fruits of his action.

        Yogakshema, refers to whatever a devotee needs. It may be material or
        spiritual. Once a yogi surrenders everything to God and performs his duties and
        worships God without any desires; the God shall look after him providing him with
        all the necessary needs. It is perhaps, the greatness of Bagavad Gita because no
        such assurance is given in any other philosophies.
