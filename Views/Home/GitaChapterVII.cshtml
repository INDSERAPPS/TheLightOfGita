                Jnana refers to the overall or complete knowledge. The analytical knowledge is called vijnana; specific knowledge. For example a peepal tree is usually very big and shady. The knowledge regarding the particular family of the tree, the quality and nature of the leaves, the possible age of the tree, the structure and nature of the roots etc; refers to vijnana or analytical knowledge. Jnana in Bagavad Gita stands for the knowledge of the Supreme, the formless and attribute less Divinity. It is discussed in this chapter as to how one can know Paramatma, his qualities and the way to attain Him etc. We can acquire the knowledge of the Supreme by engaging ourselves in the thoughts of Him and His attributes.

        The eightfold factors constituting My Prakriti are ether, air, fire, water, earth, mind, reason and ego. This is the lower nature of Prakriti called ‘Apara Prakriti’. Beyond Apara Prakriti there is the subtle Paraprakriti. The whole universe is within the Paraprakriti that sustains the seeds of life. Those consisting the five fundamental elements and the mind, the intellect and the ego are jointly called‘Asta Prakriti’ (eight fold elements of Prakriti). ParaPrakriti is beyond Apara prakriti and is more subtle. It sustains the whole Apara Prakriti. Para Prakriti is the holder and sustainer of life. The existence of Prakriti has been classified into two as above. Since ParaPrakriti is more subtle the fundamental elements do not exist in it.

The world of light of the Supreme lies beyond Para and Apara. Since the Supreme light (God) is more subtle than Para and Apara both exist within Him. Therefore God is Omnipresent.

The combined name of these three forces is Prakriti. Every being is under the influence of Prakriti. It is very difficult come out from the clutches of Her (Prakriti). It is like the legendary character Sita, went after the deer being deluded by Maya of Prakriti. Liberation is the freedom from influence of Maya. It is possible only by meditating upon Pursa the Supreme consciousness.

        Arjuna, four types of persons of noble creed worship me; those for worldly pleasures, the afflicted (suffering), persons with curiosity and the wise. Worshipping of God itself is different from person to person. Some worship God for wealth, some due to mental and physical tortures, some simply out of curiosity and the wise to know Him.     Most of the worshippers are motivated by material gains. Those who worship the Supreme, only for knowing his greatness are superior.

        Out of the four types, the best is the man of wisdom, who worships Me fixing his mind on Me with devotion. For the wise I am very loving and so he is to Me. A Jnani (wise) performs his worship to attain the Supreme and for his liberation. He knows the ultimate truth. One gets eternal peace and tranquility only when he is freed from this slavery of Prakriti. The wise worships God knowing this. He loves God and God too loves him. A dear friend advised his son ‘You shall not give others a chance to follow you’. His son was arrogant and ignorant. It is really an interesting piece of advice. Worshipping of God for money and fame is not spiritual.

        Though four type of worshippers are virtuous. The wise worshipping Me always fixing his mind on Me is really great. The aim of the wise is to attain Me alone. The wise knows that there is nothing superior to, than realizing the Supreme. The wise has stable and determinate thoughts and goal while other devotees stand for their immediate material benefits and enjoyments. Yet those worshipping God are nobler than those not worshipping Him. A true devotee surrenders his ego to God and hence not egoistic and arrogant. Others easily fall victims of arrogance and the like negativities. A wise man continuously strives for attaining the Supreme while others try to satisfy their silly desires.

True devotees are very rare as most of them are deluded by mundane pleasures. Those who worship God to attain Him are great.

The God is un-manifest and imperishable. He is the light of consciousness ever existing without definite shape or form. The Paramatma is immortal and He has no births and deaths and therefore he is formless and not having a definite form. However the wise knows Him accordingly and are able to attain Him.

Where the forces of principles of Prakriti are dominant in one’s mind he cannot have the vision of the Supreme. One cannot know God by arguments or by discussions. Arguments are the methods adopted by the egoistic and the arrogant. The presence of the Supreme is felt only in a pure mind. The foolish never realizes God. One has to surrender his ego which is a stumbling block to know the Supreme and that if he performs right actions he can attain Him. Only very few know Him really. One must refine his mind again and again to make it pure, clear and transparent so that the reflection of the Supreme light would appear in his mind.

Even at the time of death they get the memory of Me, the Supreme. Those who do right action for attaining moksha (liberation) and strive hard to deliver them from the worldly miseries forever are not attracted by worldly pleasures. Their aim is eternal peace only and they do their actions constantly, punctually and systematically. Power worshippers being motivated by physical desires remain active in satisfying their desires. In their case, the natural course of birth and death continues. Their minds are filled with craving for sensual enjoyments and are impure, unsatisfied and disturbed. We know that at the time of death of a person, people collectively do prayer for the eternal peace of the person nearing death. This remains a good ritual everywhere but the bondages of desire in one do not subside even by death.  The irony is that we, the peaceless pray for the eternal peace of the departing soul and that we do not do anything right for our peace.
