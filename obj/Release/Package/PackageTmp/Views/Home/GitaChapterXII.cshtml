                Bhakti refers to the ardent reverence to some person, concept or God. A
                pious man is simple and humble and not necessarily be a scholar; and that a
                scholar (jnani) need not be a pious devotee (Bakta). A wise scholar tries to remove
                all his doubts in the path of spirituality by logic and reasoning and by acquiring
                knowledge. But a pious devotee of God is unconcerned with such knowledge, as
                he has already surrendered everything unto God. A wise scholar observes and
                analyses everything very keenly and carefully for convincing himself of the facts.
                A Bhakta (pious devotee) is more peaceful and one who has established his
                thoughts constantly upon the Supreme. It is said that a pious devotee attains the
                realization of God soon and gets liberation much earlier than a wise devotee. A
                Bhakta has no doubt. He sees God in everything and everything in God. The
                mundane life of a Bhakta is considered a failure by many. But in the realm of
                spirituality and self-satisfaction he is much superior to anybody else. A pious
                devotee is very dear to God as he has no confusion to the right direction of his
                path.

        Arjuna said: The devotees worship you in two ways. Some by fixing their
        minds on you, worship you in the forms according to the attributes of their minds.
        But others worship you as the formless infinite consciousness. Among these
        groups who are the best knowers of the Supreme?
        The Devotees worship God as formless and infinite and other desired forms.
        Actually God is infinite and formless. But still devotees worship God in particular
        forms. Yogis opine that it is easy to worship and visualize forms representing the
        Supreme. According to them form worship and meditation give them soothing
        attention and comforts to the devotees. To worship the Supreme meditating upon
        the formless and the infinite consciousness is not easy. It is stated that form
        worship helps one to realize the Supreme more easily than worshipping the
        formless.

        Krisna said: Fixing the mind on Me, those worship Me in the right form with
        deep faith are superior than those worshipping Me in my formless and infinite
        ideation.

        Form worship is symbol worship. In symbol worship, the devotees mind can
        be arrested and directed towards the subtle and ideational realms. Their minds
        move from symbol to the idea and from idea to symbol. Form in the psychic level
        is not material but is a condensed form of an idea. Form worship is a secret way
        of worshipping God. It is an easiest technique of worship leading to the realization
        of God. Formlessly worshipping the infinite Supreme consciousness is
        comparatively difficult. Therefore a spiritual aspirant should select a proper symbol
        according to his interest. The symbols selected shall be able to generate positive
        thoughts in the devotees, directing their minds towards the Supreme
        consciousness and not towards the Supreme power.
        Power worshippers are not spiritualists. They are actually materialists and
        their minds move in the wrong and opposite direction of spirituality.

    If you are not able to do the practice of yoga you shall do all right actions
    fixing your mind on Me. You can attain the Supreme even by doing all actions
    surrendering unto God. It is yoga of Karma.
    Every right action turns to be worship to God. The practice of yoga is not
    easy for many. They find it difficult to control their mind and senses even for a few
    minutes but are always engaged in actions. For them the most suitable way to get
    relief from bondages is to do right action taking the ideation of the Supreme by
    mental exercise. The aim of worship to God is to refine one’s mind and to get rid
    of the bondages originated from actions with a view to freeing his soul form the
    slavery of the mind.

    If you are unable to do the yoga of meditation or do right karma with due
    ideation of the Supreme, you can do it by surrendering the fruits of your action unto
    Me so that you will be relieved from the bondages of action.
    It is action without desires.
    Nishkamakarma is doing all right action without self-interest of the fruits of
    action. By doing so an individual’s attachment to the fruits can be despensed with.
    Attachment means a bondage and consequent torture to the soul. The feeling of
    my and mine disappears relieving the doer in the case of Nishkama Karma. The
    devotees mind will become pure and clear.
    Nishkamakarma, i.e. without desiring for the fruits of action is a great
    message of Bagavad Gita to the whole world.

    Real knowledge (about God) is greater than the practice of yoga. Meditation
    is superior to knowledge. The sacrifice of fruits of action is superior to meditation.
    The devotee sacrificing (renouncing) the fruits of action gets peace immediately.
    Knowledge and yoga practice are different. Though some do regular yoga
    practice they may not develop real knowledge.Their interest may be physical
    wellbeing. But if one tries to improve his real knowledge, it is possible to him. The
    practice of yoga or right action, whatever it be, unless done fixing his mind on God with devotion, no desirable benefits can be achieved. One must have due interest
    to know God above all. The aim of the practice of yoga shall not be confined to
    getting relief from illness or for physical betterment. The most important purpose
    of yoga is spiritual improvement and to realize God.

    This shows all the qualities of a true devotee of God. A devotee must be
    always contented or otherwise his mind will be disturbed. He must love every being
    equally and must be generous to others so that selfish nature would disappear. He
    should have control over his senses from sensual enjoyments. It requires his mind
    and intellect to be stable. A fickle minded person cannot do any yoga practice or
    anything positive and that he cannot be relied on.
