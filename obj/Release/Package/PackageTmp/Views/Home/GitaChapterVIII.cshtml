            <p class="slokadescription">
                The term ‘Akshara’ refers to the imperishable and everlasting one.
                Imperishable one is Paramatma, the Supreme entity. It is the infinite without
                beginning or end. ‘Kshara Brahma’ is the one being formed and getting changed
                into enumerable perishable forms. There are two other classifications of Brahma;
                Nirguna Brahma and Saguna Brahma. Nirguna Brahma is a state of Supreme
                consciousness (God) without the influence of Prakriti, the natural forces. It is totally
                free from the influence of the operative principles of Prakriti; Sattvaguna, Rajoguna
                and Tamo guna. The gunas are powers constituting Prakriti or sakti. In the state of
                Nirguana, Paramatma exists in the purest form and that there is perfect
                peacefulness and bliss. This is the ultimate goal of every soul. Saguna Brahma
                represents the created universe where the forces of Prakriti are active. Saguna
                Brahma is again classified into Para Prakriti and Apara Prakriti. The forces of
                Prakriti are active in Para and Apara. Para is the unmanifest Saguna Brahma with
                only the subtle influence of Prakriti. Apara is the wide universe with its created
                forms consisting of Panchabhoota (five fundamentals elements; akas, air, agni,
                water and earth).
                <br /><br />
                The world visible or otherwise is Saguna with the influence of the qualities
                of Prakriti. Whatever we see around are subjected to change and are perishable
                in nature.It is Saguna Brahma. When a unit soul merges with the Akashra Brahma
                it shall not have any more births. Otherwise birth and deaths will go on continuously
                for every soul till its ultimate merger with the supreme. Kshara Brahma is under
                the bondage of Prakriti.

        Those who know the Supreme say that the day and night of Brahma (cosmic
        day) consist of thousands of years or ‘yugas’. Our calculation of day and night is
        based on and is related to the earth and the sun. We cannot even imagine the
        concept of day and night of the universe consisting of a number of solar systems,
        stars and planets.
        In the day of the beginning of creation (Prabhava) of Brahma all the unmanifest
        become clear and manifest. In the night (Pralaya) of Brahma all the
        manifest disappear into Brahma and become un-manifest and unknown. In the
        beginning or in the origin everything gets manifested or embodied. In the case of
        Pralaya or destruction everything merges with the primordial Prakriti (Para
        Prakriti). In Prabhava all the beings get manifested again at the beginning of the
        cosmic day. The birth and death go on indefinitely until one gets completely purified
        and merged with Nirguna Brahma (Supreme consciousness) where there is no
        influence of the forces of Prakriti. Living beings take rebirth according to their
        bondages of action.

        not. That is taking rebirth or not.
        ‘Anavarti’ refers to where there is no rebirth for a soul. Avarti means rebirth
        and death being continued. When the mind of a yogi becomes completely purified
        and refined his soul merges with the Supreme forever without a return or rebirth.
        It is Anavarti. But who has not attained that state of perfection takes further births
        till he attains perfection and that it is called Avarti.

        Some say on the death of a samnysin that he has attained liberation
        (samadhi). It is utter foolishness. This state may be applied only in one or so out
        of thousands of cases. It is a question of purity of mind, knowledge of the Supreme,
        devotion etc. The merger of the soul takes place only when the worldly desires
        come to an end. He who attains the knowledge of Brahma alone gets ultimate
        liberation. The liberation is called Nirguna Samadhi.

        A yogi leaving his body as witnessed by smoke, night, the southern

        The term yogi shall be noted that liberation is only for the yogis who have
        the knowledge of the Supreme and who are trying to attain him and not for Bhogies
        (Those deluded by earthly desires and pleasures). Liberation is a problem to the
        evolved souls only and not for a common man. A common man is always after the
        worldly pleasures and sense objects. There is a saying that the ordinary people
        may die just before the new moon. It is to confirm the nearness of death.

        There are two periods during a month; the bright fortnight and dark fortnight.
        But a yogi shall not be deluded by that, he shall continuously worship the Supreme
        irrespective of the bright and dark fortnights. It is stated that a yogi leaving his body
        in the bright fortnight of the Northern movement of the sun shall not have further
        rebirths and the one leaving the body during the dark fortnight of Dakshinayana of
        the sun takes rebirth ordinarily. Liberation comes automatically when one’s mind
        gets purified completely with the devotion of the Supreme.

        A yogi attains a state of Brahmahood, surrendering unto God all the fruits of
        his action and knowledge of the Vedas, doing sacrifices and penances and giving
        alms to the poor.
        A person who desires for the fruits of actions cannot attain the Supreme
        state.
        Bondages are formed both in doing wrong action and right actions. If one
        surrenders the fruits of action unto God he does not attract bondages.
        Those devotees visiting the famous temple of Sbarimala (deity is Dharma
        Sasta) take along with them two bags on their heads representing the fruits of right
        and wrong actions to surrender to the deity. But one must wash off the ill effect of
        evil action by himself by right action. It is not convincing as to why one surrenders
        the result of wrong action also to the deity; may be to make his mind lighter
