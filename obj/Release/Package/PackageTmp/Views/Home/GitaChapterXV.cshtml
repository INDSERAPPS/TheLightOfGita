                Parmapurusa (Supreme consciousness) is Purushotama. The process of
                attaining Purushotama is Purushotama yoga. It is the most desirable and greatest
                of all yoga practices. The aim of a true spiritual aspirant is to attain Paramapurusa
                who is beyond the purview of the forces of Prakriti. The Purusa is Omnipresent,
                Omnipotent and Omniscient. It is a process to attain or become one with the
                Supreme Purusa. Akshara Brahma is beyond the influence of the three forces
                (gunatita). Purushotama is totally free from the forces of Sattva, Raja and
                Tamogunas. The aim of everybody must be to reach Him at the state of blissfulness. When one is totally free from the grip of gunas or Prakriti, he attains
                the all loving Purushotama.

        The jivatma (unit consciousness) is a particle of the Supreme being which is
        attracted by the mind and is controlled by the sensory organs by the interactions
        of the operative principles of Prakriti.
        The mind encircles the soul which is beyond the senses and the principles
        of Prakriti. The unit self is covered by the delusion of mind keeping it under the
        control and bondage. Therefore the soul suffers or enjoys the fruits or the results
        of actions of the mind. Mind being the combination of the principles of Prakriti is
        blind, without the soul. Therefore even the feeling of ‘I’ is caused by the presence
        of the unit soul. Moksha (liberation) refers to the total freedom of the soul from the
        slavery of the mind.

        The jivatma while leaving the body along with mind and the principles of
        senses moves in search of another body. As the wind moves taking the scents of
        flowers, the reactions in their potential forms of actions are transferred from one
        body and enters into another.
        Karmapasas (bondage of actions) are transferred from one birth to another
        until they are removed by purifying one’s mind by the practice of yoga with true
        ideation of the Supreme.

        The jivatma (soul) enjoys the sense objects with the help of mind and senses

        The soul is under the bondages of Prakriti; Sattva, Raja and Tama gunas. It
        is like a caged bird enjoying the food offered to it. But the bird always wishes to get
        out of the confinement; such is the condition of the soul being enslaved by the
