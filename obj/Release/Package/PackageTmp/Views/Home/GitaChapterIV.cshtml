                There seldom exists right knowledge or right action alone. Right action and right knowledge are jointly called JnanaKarmayoga. Samnyasa refers to one’s total surrender to God.The way by which one can lead to a peaceful life, surrendering himself to God is discussed in this chapter. What is important is yoga i.e. the union of soul with the God. The ultimate goal of every soul is its communion with the Supreme consciousness.

            <p class="slokadescription">
                Normally there is an aversion to the term moksha or liberation, to many. Some one say, “I do work hard for my own benefit and not for moksha.” It is due to the fact that he does not know the meaning of the term moksha. It means complete freedom of the soul from all the bondages and the merger of the self with the Supreme in a blissful state. One has to liberate himself from the state of happiness and miseries. At the state of perfect peacefulness one is totally free from internal and external bondages, miseries or joy. Everybody does his action knowingly or unknowingly to attain the state of complete peace and tranquility. Freedom is not to do anything and everything but to do the right action without being the slave of the mind. Positive actions take one towards God, whereas the negative deeds keep him away from the Supreme Self.
            </p>
            <p class="slokadescription">
                Wrong action binds ones soul to the mundanities and the consequent tortures of the atma. But most of the people do not know the fact. A story comes to the mind. A boy who was very poor and humble, gets a good job, soon after passing his degree and becomes so arrogant, changing his attitude in talk and looks. He used to make complaints of his heavy work but was mainly concerned with his fairly high income. Once a gentleman asked him whether he had any complaints in taking delicious food and that instantly stopped his complaints of the hard work. He does not know that he is torturing his soul without being satisfied with the job he got by God’s grace and the good income. Such a person shall never be happy or peaceful in his life unless he changes his attitude. One must be committed to his duty and perform right actions surrendering his self (ego) to the Supreme. Usually surrendering to the Divine or valuing the words of the Guru is only till one becomes financially independent.

        Krisna said: I taught the secret knowledge of the immortal yoga first to ‘Vivasan’ (Sun god). Vivasan imparted this knowledge to his son Manu and Manu to his son Iksvaku.  This shows that yoga vidya (the practice of yoga) existed from time immemorial and is immortal. The miseries and pains disturb human mind always. He wants relief from his worries. But man’s prayer is to free from worries and not from happiness. If there is happiness there is pain too. Both are either sides of the same coin. The miseries and happiness here refer to sense related experiences. But ultimate happiness (peace) is not related to senses and is beyond the senses. Freedom forever from sensual pleasures and pains is liberation. It is not attained by death. Therefore committing suicide is not a way to escape from pain and pleasure. Births and deaths would be followed by the potentials of the results caused by ones actions. Mind carries along with the soul the bondages of actions all along from birth to births until the mind is completely purified.

        The knowledge of yoga transmitted from generation to generation remained known to the royal sages and lost its greatness, spirit and relevance in the course of time. Any practical knowledge shall lose its significance, if not properly followed, by the passage of time. The same is applicable to yoga vidya too. Novelty refers to improving and modifying of the old according to the needs of the time. Human mind is compared to a copper bangle that requires polishing every day or otherwise it would become impure. It becomes clear that one’s mind will remain pure and shining only by refining it every day.

Yogavidya has now become a tradable service. It may lead to many miseries as it is imparted against the advices of great seers or Gurus.

        Arjuna asked, that Vivsvan’s period of life traces back to antiquity and therefore how can I believe that you really imparted yoga to him?  It is said that great Gurus are the representatives of God. They are immortal and will always be present and that they do not attain liberation. They would be present on earth to guide others. They change their body from one to another; change of form only. Birth, death and rebirth are hard cores to the Western philosophies. To know this too, one needs purity of mind and thought. Many want sensual enjoyments even by practicing yoga.

        Sri Krisna said: Arjuna, there had been many births to you and Me. I know them all but you do not. It reiterates that the knowledge of Bagavad Gita is based on rebirths though the religions like Islam, Christianity etc. do not believe it. But they mention about the life after death; i.e; about hell and heaven. The philosophies originated in the East, very deeply analyze this concept and it seems more logical and convincing.

        Arjuna, though I am unborn and deathless I manifest myself with the help of my yoga maya, the divine Prakriti and maintain my own nature under my control.   Sadgurus are the true representatives of the Supreme. They have overcome the phenomenon of births and deaths and are therefore immortal. They take births at their own will. Ordinary human beings get rebirth in accordance with their bondages of karma. They are not free. Birth and death continues to them until they get liberation.

        Whenever there is a decline of righteousness and there is upper hand of evil forces, in the society, I Myself reincarnate.

        It is always the virtuous who suffer much pain and miseries for they partake the miseries of others. When there is an impending great tragedy to the virtuous, a great Guru or redeemer takes birth to protect the good from the wrong doers. The great Gurus are those able to keep their minds always in the thoughts of the Divine. There is a continuous conflict between the good and the evil in the society and in the individuals.

        Arjuna, howsoever people may worship Me I bestow them with My blessings.  The concept of God is not the same to everybody, and that the symbols or deities of worship are also different. Most of the people worship God for their material gains and not for knowing God or for liberation. The worshippers seldom state that they worship the Divine for the purification of their minds and to attain God. The People worshipping God for the satisfaction of their desires may get their objects of pleasure but their souls will be further bound by bondages.

It is to release the soul from the grip of the mind to merge it with the Paramatma.

        The four orders of the society were created by Me, categorizing the people according to their nature on the basis of the influence of the operating principles of Prakriti acting in them; though I do karma I am not bound by action (karma). An individual’s mind is influenced by the operative principles of Prakriti; Sattva, Rajo, Tamogunas. According to the intensity and combination of these forces there is change in the structure and nature of one’s mind. He whose mind is predominantly influenced by Sattvaguna (sentient force) is called Brahmana and those predominant by Rajoguna and next by Sattva guna are called Ksatriyas. Persons predominantly influenced by Tamo guna and secondly by Rajoguna are called Vaisyas. And those influenced predominantly by Tamo guna without considerable influence of other forces are called Sudras. This has no relevance to the categorization based on the community in which one is born. ‘Janmana Jayate Sudra and Karmana Jayate Dvija, is a Vedic statement which means that everybody is Sudra by birth. Dvija refers to a person who by right action has modified his mental structure in such a way where Sattva guna has become predominant. The state of Brahmamahood can be attained by right action even by other categories by the constant ideation of the Divine. This concept of Bagavad Gita has been misconceived and misinterpreted by many stating that the four Varnas (categories) are by birth. Thus Brahmanas are those engaged in the pursuit of priesthood and worshipping in temples. Ksatriyas are those protecting the society from the enemies, Vaisyas doing business and rearing of domestic animals and Sudras doing menial work for the other three categories.

A true yogi is he who is able to shun away the bondages of action. Spiritual progress is arrested by the actions bringing bondages to the doer.

The ‘I’ feeling (the doer ship feeling) and the ownership feeling attract bondage of action. When action is performed as a Divine guidance no bondage of action exists in the mind of the doer.

The desire to see is generated by the sense of eye. So are the desires to hear, taste and to touch and smell. Performing homa (sacrifice) with deep ideation of the Divine would essentially help one to do away with mental distress caused by negative and subtle forces.

        Some do the act of sacrifice of Prana (the vital airs) and senses into the divine fire of yoga, by controlling their minds; in the light of practical wisdom. Prana refers to the vital airs. The secret of paranayama is to control the senses and thoughts by long and deep inhaling of air into one and slowly exhaling it out. In the view of the Masters of yoga pranayama helps to normalize the blood circulation, so also the thoughts. It needs a proper Guru otherwise it may lead to more complications. The experience of a real yogi is that ignorance can be burned in the fire of knowledge.

        Some people do sacrifice with the prescribed materials, some others do thapa yajna and some do yogic exercises. Yajna refers to a karma (action) being done with utmost carefulness and seriousness. Some others do yajna of scientific knowledge or wisdom as revealed by secret scriptures. Sacrifices are performed with definite purposes. Yajna performed for a common cause becomes a real sacrifice. Sacrifices also mean giving up one’s enjoyment for others, i.e. doing action without selfish motive. In a homa negative forces of subtle vibrations are attracted and put into the sacrificial fire through the medium of materials like ghee, beated rice, camphor, oil, mustard seeds, kernel of coconut and so on. Though it looks unreasonable and illogical; to a common mind, from experience, it has been found that such practices are very useful. It is based on the deep and subtle psychological science. Everybody is not expected to know the secret of sacrifice or to perform sacrifices.

        Spiritual aspirants have found that by controlling the function of lungs with the help of long inhalations and slow exhalations of air (pranayama) they can control their senses and thoughts. By controlled food habits and regular yogic exercises like pranayama one can control his vital forces.

        The air we take in is called prana and the air we exhale is called Apana. The time gap between inhaling and exhaling is called Ayama.

        The leftover materials used in the sacrifice to the deities are considered as nectar by the devotees. Therefore it is said that the left over materials are the blessings of the God, which are not bound by the bondages of action.  If a person takes food, only after submitting it to the deity, represented by the Divine regularly, in the long run his mind will become pure and unaffected by the bondage of action and attain liberation from worldly miseries. The inner feelings must be of total surrender. We have experiences that at famous temples there are long queues of devotees to get the leftover food items sacrificed to the deities. There is a science behind it, a psychological science of getting inner peace.

        Arjuna, Sacrifice through knowledge is superior to the sacrifices being performed with material things. However all sacrifices ultimately culminate into knowledge.  Sacrifices are performed in the sacred fire chanting divine words (mantras) and syllables, offering into the fire, materials like ghee, beated rice, pieces of coconut kernel, and nine important cereals etc. The ideational meaning of the mantras is related to knowledge.

Siting near the Guru, ask him of your doubts slowly with true inquisitiveness. One should not argue with great seers or Gurus and shall not criticize them. If the Guru is pleased and satisfied with you he would impart you the real knowledge to march ahead to the goal of the Divine.

        Even though you are the worst of all the sinners, by attaining real knowledge you shall cross over all the sins like a raft floating in the water.

When the impurities are cleaned and washed off by good actions his mind will shine by the real knowledge. The story of Ratnakara is an example. Ratnakara, a notorious sinner became a great sage like Vatmiki when his sins were washed off completely, by severe penance and devotion to God.
